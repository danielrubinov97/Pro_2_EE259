PROJECT 2 DESCRIPTION:

Write a C++ class definition called SORT_INFO which will perform 
the following tasks. SORT_INFO class will inherit from STUDENT_GRADE
class, which in turn inherits from STUDENT_ID class.

The prototype for the  class SORT_INFO  is defined as follows:

  class SORT_INFO:public STUDENT_GRADE{
   public:      // public methods for this class

        SORT_INFO(int, int); // example: b.SORT_INFO(x, y);
				// constructor;
				// x is noof students, y is noof projects

        void SORT_ID(char *); // example: b.SORT_GRADE("ASCENDING");
				// method to sort student ids in ascending or 
				// descending order; returns no values;

        void SORT_GRADE(char *, int); // example: b.SORT_GRADE("ASCENDING", 2);
				// method to sort grades for a given exam in 
				// ascending or descending order; returns no values;

        void SORT_NAME(char *); // example: b.SORT_NAME("ASCENDING");
			    	// method to sort students by their last names
			    	// in alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order; 
				// returns no values;

   // protected vars below can only be accessed within this class and inherited classes
   // they are not directly accessible from main
   protected: 
	char LastName[20][12];   // array to hold student's last name
	char FirstName[20][12];  // array to hold student,s first name
   };

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The objects of SORT_INFO class will read the input values from a file called
studentName.txt given with the following format:

	LastName_1 FirstName_1 
	LastName_2 FirstName_2 
	...
	LastName_n FirstName_n 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

An example use of the constructor is as follows:

        SORT_INFO X(w, z); 

which instantiates an object X of class SORT_INFO.  Integers w and z
represent the number of students and exams, respectively. This constructor 
will call the constructor of the base class SORT_GRADE and read the information 
from studentName.txt into the protected arrays of LastName and FirstName. 

The output to out.2.txt file is:

	++++ P2 START ++++
	++++ P2 OUTPUT FROM STUDENT_GRADE CONSTRUCTOR:
	++++ P2 AN OBJECT OF SORT_INFO IS CREATED.
	++++ P2 END ++++

Note that the constructors for STUDENT_GRADE and STUDENT_ID will also
generate their own outputs automatically as they are called by the
constructors.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Definition of SORT_ID method is as follows:

	G.SORT_ID(ORDER);

where G is an object of class SORT_INFO, and ORDER is a character string.

If ORDER is "ASCENDING", this method sorts the student ids in ascending order.
The output to out_2.txt file is:

	++++ P2 START ++++
	++++ P2 OUTPUT FROM SORT_ID METHOD:
	++++ P2 BEFORE SORTING IN ASCENDING ORDER:
	++ P1 START ++
	++ P1 OUTPUT FROM LIST_IDS METHOD:
	+ P0 START +
	+ P0 OUTPUT FROM LIST_ID METHOD:
	+ P0 STUDENT IDS FOR z STUDENTS:
	+ P0 id_0
	...
	+ P0 id_z-1
	+ P0 END +
	++ P1 END ++
	++++ P2 AFTER SORTING IN ASCENDING ORDER:
	++ P1 START ++
	++ P1 OUTPUT FROM LIST_IDS METHOD:
	+ P0 START +
	+ P0 OUTPUT FROM LIST_ID METHOD:
	+ P0 STUDENT IDS FOR z STUDENTS:
	+ P0 id_0
	...
	+ P0 id_z-1
	+ P0 END +
	++ P1 END ++
	++++ P2 END ++++

where z is the number of students. Here before and after perform 
sorting, you call LIST_IDS method defined in STUDENT_GRADE class.

If ORDER is "DESCENDING", this method sorts the student ids in 
descending order. Output is very similar except the word
"ASCENDING" is replaced by "DESCENDING".

If ORDER is set to anything else, the output to out.2.txt is:

	++++ P2 START ++++
	++++ P2 OUTPUT FROM SORT_ID METHOD:
	++++ P2 INPUT ERROR
	++++ P2 END ++++

Please see Example 2 below.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The definition of SORT_GRADE method is as follows:

	G.SORT_GRADE(ORDER, x);

where G is a object of class SORT_INFO, ORDER is a character string, 
and integer x is the exam number. 

If ORDER is set to "ASCENDING", the exam x grade will be sorted in ascending 
order and the output to out.2.txt file will be:

	++++ P2 START ++++
	++++ P2 OUTPUT FROM SORT_GRADE METHOD:
	++++ P2 BEFORE SORTING IN ASCENDING ORDER:
	++ P1 START ++
	++ P1 OUTPUT FROM LIST_IDS METHOD:
	+ P0 START +
	+ P0 OUTPUT FROM LIST_ID METHOD:
	+ P0 STUDENT IDS FOR z STUDENTS:
	+ P0 id_0
	...
	+ P0 id_z-1
	+ P0 END +
	++ P1 END ++
	++++ P2 AFTER SORTING IN ASCENDING ORDER:
	++ P1 START ++
	++ P1 OUTPUT FROM LIST_IDS METHOD:
	+ P0 START +
	+ P0 OUTPUT FROM LIST_ID METHOD:
	+ P0 STUDENT IDS FOR z STUDENTS:
	+ P0 id_0
	...
	+ P0 id_z-1
	+ P0 END +
	++ P1 END ++
	++++ P2 END ++++

where z is the number of students. Here before and after perform 
sorting, you call LIST_IDS method defined in STUDENT_GRADE class.

If ORDER is "DESCENDING", this method will perform sorting in 
descending order. Output is very similar except the word
"ASCENDING" is replaced by "DESCENDING".

If ORDER is set to anything else, and/or x is illegal, the output to 
out.2.txt is:

	++++ P2 START ++++
	++++ P2 OUTPUT FROM SORT_ID METHOD:
	++++ P2 INPUT ERROR
	++++ P2 END ++++

Please see Example 3 below.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The definition of SORT_NAME method is as follows:

	G.SORT_NAME(ORDER);

where G is a object of class SORT_INFO and ORDER is a character string. 

If ORDER is set to "ASCENDING", the last names will be sorted in alphabetical 
order and the output to out.2.txt file will be:

	++++ P2 START ++++
	++++ P2 OUTPUT FROM SORT_NAME METHOD:
	++++ P2 BEFORE SORTING LAST NAMES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER:
	++ P1 START ++
	++ P1 OUTPUT FROM LIST_IDS METHOD:
	+ P0 START +
	+ P0 OUTPUT FROM LIST_ID METHOD:
	+ P0 STUDENT IDS FOR z STUDENTS:
	+ P0 id_0
	...
	+ P0 id_z-1
	+ P0 END +
	++ P1 END ++
	++++ P2 AFTER SORTING LAST NAMES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER:
	++ P1 START ++
	++ P1 OUTPUT FROM LIST_IDS METHOD:
	+ P0 START +
	+ P0 OUTPUT FROM LIST_ID METHOD:
	+ P0 STUDENT IDS FOR z STUDENTS:
	+ P0 id_0
	...
	+ P0 id_z-1
	+ P0 END +
	++ P1 END ++
	++++ P2 END ++++

where z is the number of students. Here before and after perform 
sorting, you call LIST_IDS method defined in STUDENT_GRADE class.

If ORDER is "DESCENDING", this method will perform sorting in 
descending order. Output is very similar except the word
"ALPHABETICAL" is replaced by "REVERSE ALPHABETICAL".

If ORDER is set to anything else, and/or x is illegal, the output to 
out.2.txt is:

	++++ P2 START ++++
	++++ P2 OUTPUT FROM SORT_NAME METHOD:
	++++ P2 INPUT ERROR
	++++ P2 END ++++
